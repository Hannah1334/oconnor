<h1>Basic Information</h1>
<b>Name:</b> Claire O'Connor<br>
<b>Age:</b> Early Twenties<br>
<b>Birthdate:</b> April 26th<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Cisgender Female<br>
<b>Sexuality:</b> Bisexual<br>
<b>Relationship:</b> Taken (<a target="_blank" href="http://atomic.chatango.com">Miles Parker</a>)<br>
<b>Species:</b> Human<br>
<b>Race:</b> Irish-American<br>
<b>Trees:</b> Forcient: Transmutation & Ritualism<br>
<b>Occupation:</b> Student at <a target="_blank" href="http://ulreich.weebly.com">Ulreich University</a><br>
<b>Height:</b> 5'9"<br>
<b>Weight:</b> 130 lbs.<br><br>
<h1>Detailed Information</h1>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
Natural beauty shapes her entire appearance. Her physique--while still having defined feminine curves--is more on the slim side. Soft perfect porcelain skin perfectly stretches across her body. Her face is more rounded, with a soft jaw and gently pronounced cheekbones. A cute button nose and full pink lips rest under a pair of big green eyes that almost have an inhuman glow to them. Dark black hair frames her beautiful face and falls down to her mid-back.
<br><br>
<b>Attire</b><br>
Claire's fashion sense is very modest, finding her in short skirts and v-necks is a very very rare occasion. She prefers leggings and jeans as well as long-sleeved sweaters and cute fashionable jackets. Scarves and hats are common accessory choices.
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
An extremely shy girl who tends to be completely silent if she feels overwhelmed by the presence of others. She is very humble, gentle, and sweet but that can often cause her some problems. It makes her easy to manipulate. She has the strong maternal desire to care for broken things and wants to see the good in everyone no matter what.
</div>

<div id="tab1">
<h1>How She Came To Be...</h1>
Claire O'Connor was born to Jane and Patrick O'Connor early on the morning of April 26th. Already the two had a son named Ryan who was just over a year her elder. The two of them had a pretty rough life at such a young age, before the girl even learned to take her first steps their father walked out on their family, never to be heard from again. It was rumored that an obsession with music was what drove him away. As Claire got older, the absence of her father drew her and her elder brother much closer together. He developed a very protective bias around his sister, while she became almost completely dependent on his company around other people. Unfortunately there came a time when she had to learn how to deal with the world without him by her side.<br><br>
What happened was that their mother held a deep grudge against their father for leaving her, and Ryan was very much like his father in many ways, especially with his love for music. He became a very talented musician which angered her to the point of even kicking him out of the house. While Claire was technically forbidden to see him, he stayed with an uncle of theirs who took advantage of the poor boy's situation in almost every way imaginable, so the topic of running away was something commonly brought up between them. Ryan always refused his sister's begging to take her with him, and one day he really did up and leave her behind, breaking her heart. Rather than become bitter like their mother, Claire did everything she could to search for him and either stay by his side or bring him home.<br><br>
Her search brought her deeper and deeper into the dangerous immortal world of magic where she eventually learned he was a student at a magical school, learning how to harnass his mana and cast powerful spells as he rose through the ranks. Equally ambitious, Claire pursued this school herself and eventually ended up finding not only her brother but also an unfortunate trap. Mages seeking to harm him raped and murdered the poor girl, introducing her to her first real traumatic experience. She was brought back to life by the school's most powerful Faith Mage, but the mental scars left behind was something the kind woman couldn't save her from. While Claire only sank further into her introvert behavior, Ryan only grew more protective and possessive of his sister.<br><br>
Ironically, she ended up finding solace in the company of another young mage named Miles, and a young romance blossomed between the two of them. While Ryan's ultimate goal was to bring her back home permanently and let her live the rest of her days in the simple mortal human world, her own ambitions to equal in power to both of the most important men in her life brought her stubbornly back on the lookout for another magical academy. Eventually her search led her to a place known as Ulreich University, where she currently prepares to study the arcane arts...

<div id="tab3">
<h1>Items</h1>
<b>Small Backpack</b><br>
A bookbag typical of the average High Schooler to carry their materials needed around in. For Claire, it is just a small sack that currently carries general toiletries (like deodorant, hairbrush, toothbrush, etc.) and female-specific toiletries (like make-up, perfume, etc.).
<br><br>
<b>Small Purse</b><br>
Just large enough to hold a couple smaller items and a bit of money, with a long leather strap designed specifically for the satchel to be carried across the body and over one shoulder. Currently the only thing it holds is money, but may carry small female-specific toiletries.
<br><br>
<b>Small Suitcase</b><br>
After she settles into her Dorm, this item will probably never be used again--unless she leaves for some reason. It only holds several articles of clothing neatly folded and tightly packed within its small dimensions.
<br><br>
<b>Waterskin</b><br>
Claire carries with her a water-skin satchel that has been repurposed to hold sand.
<br><br>
<h1>Weapons</h1>
<b>Small Dagger</b><br>
Claire always carries a small blade within her purse that is retractable into its hilt much like a box knife. This particular weapon has no magic qualities and is only made of iron.
<br><br>
<h1>High Archmage Medium</h1>
<b>Light's Vision</b><br>
A broadsword, created out of what seems to be a magical crystal. This crystal is extremely durable and near impossible to crack or break (Diamond toughness), and acts as a perfect material for a bladed weapon, however it is also able to shift into a small paint brush whenever needed. While in paintbrush form, channeling mana through the object will give the mana a solid form (constructs of steel grade) that can be used like ink to draw runes in the air.<br>
(Runes drawn into existence with the paintbrush take two posts to activate, even if the runes themselves usually only take a single post)<br>
The blade's original owner used the crystal to refract light through for a boost to his Photokinetics spells, and while light will still refract through the strange artifact it won't offer its new owner any special abilities. Instead, the blade acts as a conduit for Claire's magic and passes as an extension of her being (meaning with spells that require physical contact she can use the blade to make that contact instead of her flesh so long as she is at least touching the sword), as well as a special catalyst that allows her to filter base gases (such as oxygen) through the blade, allowing her to transmute these gases and use them as base materials for any of her spells so long as the sword is being used as a catalyst for her magic. (This only includes spells currently in her inventory, including the ones getting approved for her High Archmage slots, but any spells afterward would require to be specifically pitched to work in tangent with this ability.)<br>
She is able to transmute the material of the blade into molten glass (hot enough to melt through Diamond, and despite technically being a liquid the blade still fully retains its shape) but when the ability is deactivated/cancelled the blade reverts to its normal material and shape.<br>
This superheated molten form can splatter drops of itself when the blade is swung in an arch (splash zone radius of up to fifteen feet, able to travel up to thirty feet in a specified direction away from the caster) and so long as these drops don't get further than forty feet from the caster she can transmute their state of matter, or, use them as transmutable base materials to make any of her other spells currently available to her. (This only includes spells currently in her inventory, including the ones getting approved for her High Archmage slots, but any spells afterward would require to be specifically pitched to work in tangent with this ability.)<br>
When using the tip of the blade to carve out or draw runes, Claire receives a moderate reduction to the typical mana cost (35%) for casting the spells she is crafting (this is only 15% for Archmage spells, intended as a Ritualism specific buff).

<h1>Mana Manipulation</h1>
<i>"The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level. (Most spells taught in class are under this tree. Spells taught in class must be on your character sheet, and any alterations or upgrades to taught spells must be discussed with a professor.)"</i><br><br>
<b>Natural Aura</b><br>
Claire's physical manifestation of her mana causes the strange magic substance to take on a dark evergreen hue, but the darker or lighter tones of this color may change depending on her overall mood.<br>
<i>"Green, the color of life, renewal, nature, and energy, is associated with meanings of growth, harmony, freshness, safety, fertility, and environment."</i>
<br><br>
Having gathered the Universal Spells from various mentors and teachers, as well as attending classes, Claire has managed to learn all (save for Mana Graft) of the spells available to students of her rank.

<p align="center"><i>Alterglyphics, High Archmage</i></p>
<i>An entirely new Magic Tree, compromised of Transmutation and Ritualism. With both of them combined, Claire has managed to develop the following epic spells:</i>
<br><br>
<h1>Archmage Spells</h1>
<b>Constructive Change (Upgrade)</b><br>
A spell that allows the caster to change the state of matter in physical and magic-imbued substances and materials after coming in physical contact with them (within two posts of contact, longer than that waiting to change will deactivate and require recasting) (can work on magically affected objects, such as enchanted objects, but does not work specifically on magic. Energy-based substances cannot be affected) so long as they are no higher in toughness or density as titanium, and aren't materials from higher ranking spells than the caster (Titanium, the spell scales different than the regular toughness scale provided by the Alumni page). The objects in question can only be up to the twice the size and weight of the caster, and as long as she touched the base material before it was changed she can expend mana to continuously change it assuming it remains within a twenty-five foot radius of her body. This does not work for biological or sentient material, and it does not allow her to fluctuate temperatures. For example, if she were to transmute steel into molten liquid steel, her magic would keep the liquid from actually being able to burn and would allow it to remain room temperature.
<br>
When used specifically with her runes and the magic they produce, however, not only can she change the states of matter of the runes themselves and their effects, but she can buff up their densities and toughness grades to be equal to this spell's rank (again, Titanium). Only works on her own runes made and activated by her own magic.
<br><br>
<b>Glass Globe (Upgrade)</b><br>
This spell allows the caster to transmute physical objects and materials (so long as they are only Tungsten in toughness or lower, aren't made from higher ranking spells, and aren't any bigger than the twice the caster's size and/or weight) into basketball sized globes of molten glass just hot enough to melt through Tungsten constructs or non-magic items. If used like a projectile the orb can only travel up to thirty feet away from the caster. Once the globe hits a solid surface it will behave like a liquid and if left on that surface for extended periods of time (two rotations) it will harden, but the caster can now also change the state of matter of these orbs between molten glass and solid glass at will (in exchange for extra mana) so long as the puddles are within a forty foot radius of her. Cannot reach speeds over 60 MPH. The caster can have a total of eight of these basketball sized orbs active at once, or, she can create up to two massive ones that can expand to cover a whole ten foot radius. Continuously attempting to expand a massive orb beyond this limitation will cause it to pop and send the molten liquid flying everywhere like an explosion.<br>
Combining the aspects of Transmutation and Ritualism can allow the caster to manipulate individual sections of the orbs this spell creates into forming a very specific rune that, when activated, solidifies the toxic gases molten glass naturally emits into spikes that, if kept around long enough for the massive bubbles to burst, will remain solid and scatter like shrapnel. If any of these spikes or shards manage to break the flesh they cause intense acidic burns that can eat through a whole limb or small section of the typical body/organic material.<br>
The spikes themselves are only as durable as iron and can either be a small coating of the molten glass orb's entire surface by being three inches in length and width, or, can manifest as a singular spike which can expand to be ten feet in length with a two foot girth at the most.
<br><br>
<b>Window Pane (Upgrade)</b><br>
This spell allows the caster to transmute physical objects and materials (so long as they are only Tungsten in toughness or lower, aren't made from higher ranking spells, and aren't any bigger than twice the caster's size and/or weight) into panes of molten glass hot enough to melt through Tungsten magic-constructs or non-magic items. While these panes cannot be used as projectiles they can remain active within twenty-five feet of the caster. When deactivated or "broken" the panes will revert to the base material they were transmuted from. The caster can have a total of four of these panes active at once, and they can only be up to ten feet in height and width at the most. The panes themselves can only defend against solid existing objects and will not be able to deter pure energy substances whatsoever.<br>
However, in a similar way to the way she combines aspects of both her trees in Glass Globe, the caster can manipulate a small section of the panes to form a very specific rune in them. When activated, this rune coats the molten glass in an extra layer of mana that specifically defends against pure energy based spells and attacks. Since her secondary tree is only mage in rank, her defense can only stand against energy based attacks equal to that rank.
<br><br>
<b>Dark Smog</b><br>
Starting off as a simple rune, when the sigil itself is activated it creates a field of transmutative energy that forms a thick black smoke which covers an entire thirty foot radius and is distinctly harmless. While the smog is intended to heavily obstruct vision, movement and energy readings within its radius of effect (so long as both things aren't intentionally being hidden by spells of equal rank or higher) will be relayed to the caster so long as she is also within the vision obstructing fog. <br>
So long as she has physical contact with part of the magical mass she can manipulate sections of it to harden into glass constructs with Tungsten durabilities at will, and with enough focus can even transmute the substance into specific formations she desires. While transmuting the mist does cost extra mana, the rune only continues to create the field (and reform the fog) for five rotations so long as the caster remains at least within a forty foot radius of it. <br>
(If hardening fog around another sentient being/mage, the process is slowed, allowing them a chance to remove themselves from danger. Slow =/= more than one rotation.)<br>
Should the caster come in recent physical contact with another entity while they are within the smog (recent being up to two rotations), if they have inhaled any of the smoke into their lungs she is able to transmute that smoke into a solid while it is within them, just as she would be able to with the rest of it.<br>
The fog can be dispelled or pushed away by magical means so long as the spells doing so are at least Expert Mage in rank (takes time to blow away NOT instant) or higher (post HM rank path 1 or higher spells will have an instant effect). 
<br><br>
<b>Noclip (Upgrade)</b><br>
Rather than transmuting the air into magical blocks to sustain her weight, the caster now has the option of transmuting the air into a very specific runic formation designed for this spell. Upon activation, the rune either attaches to an existing nonmagic surface (of Tungsten or lower, or magically imbued surfaces of lower rank than the caster) or creates a surface of its own (fabricated surface or not will only have a forty foot radius of effect) that the caster can shift the nature of at will that will allow physical entities or objects she can acknowledge are there to either pass through the surface as though it were a liquid or stay strong and firm. 
<br>
Regardless of whether or not the surface is solid, her magic allows it to retain its shape and appearance so that it may seem like a solid in appearance despite being transmuted into a liquid form.
<br>
If the surface is fabricated in the air it will be able to stay in one place, the caster cannot move it around only form it and deactivate it. It will only be able to be formed up to forty feet above the ground's surface, and will be up to Tungsten in durability.
<br><br>
<h1>High Archmage Spells</h1>
<b>Glass Globe (Upgrade)</b><br>
This spell allows the caster to transmute physical objects and materials (so long as they are only Diamond in toughness or lower, aren't made from higher ranking spells, and aren't any bigger than the twice the caster's size and/or weight) into basketball sized globes of molten glass just hot enough to melt through Diamond constructs or nonmagic items (and up to Titanium-equivalent pure energy based attacks/constructs/etc). If used like a projectile the orb can only travel up to sixty feet away from the caster. Once the globe hits a solid surface it will behave like a liquid and if left on that surface for extended periods of time (two rotations) it will harden, but the caster can now also change the state of matter of these orbs between molten glass and solid glass at will (in exchange for extra mana) so long as the puddles are within a seventy foot radius of her. Cannot reach speeds over 90 MPH. The caster can have a total of twelve of these basketball sized orbs active at once, or, she can create up to three massive ones that can expand to cover a whole ten foot radius. Continuously attempting to expand a massive orb beyond this limitation will cause it to pop and send the molten liquid flying everywhere like an explosion (popping sends liquid flying for twice bubble's size aka twenty foot radius).<br>
Combining the aspects of Transmutation and Ritualism can allow the caster to manipulate individual sections of the orbs this spell creates into forming a very specific rune that, when activated, solidifies the toxic gases molten glass naturally emits into spikes that, if kept around long enough for the massive bubbles to burst, will remain solid and scatter like shrapnel. If any of these spikes or shards manage to break the flesh they cause intense acidic burns that can eat through a whole limb or moderate section of the typical body/organic material.<br>
The spikes themselves are only as durable as steel and can either be a small coating of the molten glass orb's entire surface by being three inches in length and width, or, can manifest as a singular spike which can expand to be ten feet in length with a two foot girth at the most. These solid spikes can now be affected by the spell "Constructive Change". The farther away the objects are the longer it should take for them to switch states.
<br><br>
<b>Dark Smog (Upgrade)</b><br>
Starting off as a simple rune, when the sigil itself is activated it creates a field of transmutative energy that forms a thick black smoke which covers an entire fifty foot radius and is distinctly harmless. While the smog is intended to heavily obstruct vision and scramble lower ranked sensory abilities/spells (post high mage rank 1 if target is within the smoke's range, high mage from the outside looking in), movement and energy readings within its radius of effect (so long as both things aren't intentionally being hidden by spells of equal rank or higher) will be relayed to the caster so long as she is also within the vision obstructing fog. <br>
So long as she remains within the same radius the smog covers she can manipulate sections of it to harden into glass constructs with up to Diamond durabilities at will, and with enough focus can even transmute the substance into specific formations she desires. While transmuting the mist does cost extra mana, the rune only continues to activate the fog for seven rotations so long as the caster remains at least within a sixty foot radius of it. <br>
(If hardening fog around another sentient being/mage, the process is slowed, allowing them a chance to remove themselves from danger. Slow =/= more than one rotation.)<br>
Once the smog has been transmuted into a solid state, the caster unlocks the ability to further transmute it back and forth between a molten glass state and a solid state. The molten glass state has the capability of melting away Diamond grade magic/nonmagic constructs as well as forms of pure energy up to High Mage equivalent. Solid state must be achieved first before molten state can be engaged at all.<br>
Should the caster come in recent physical contact with another entity while they are within the smog (recent being up to four rotations), if they have inhaled any of the smoke into their lungs she is able to transmute that smoke into a solid while it is within them, just as she would be able to with the rest of it.<br>
The fog can be dispelled or pushed away by magical means so long as the spells doing so are at least High Mage in rank (takes time to blow away NOT instant) or higher (post HM rank path 2 or higher spells will have an instant effect). 
<br><br>
<b>Noclip (Upgrade)</b><br>
The caster is capable of using the old version of No Clip, transmuting air into clear aerogel-like levitating blocks just strong enough to hold her weight, for up to sixty feet above the ground (or most recent surface that actually holds her weight she's been in contact with). She can also, however, use the upgraded Archmage version as well, which allows her to transmute a rune into/out of any diamond-or-lesser substance (diamond for nonmagic, tungsten for any magically-imbued objects/constructs). If this rune is imbued into a surface and activated she will be able to manipulate the solid state of said material into a liquid one in any variation of space (within a seventy foot radius of the source) so long as she is within sixty feet of the rune herself. Even in a liquid state, the surface will retain its normal shape and appearance, even its normal temperature will not change. <br>
Should the rune be made out of air, however, it will create a levitating platform that the caster can shift the nature of at will (in any variation along the material's surface/makeup) that will allow physical entities or objects she can acknowledge are there to either pass through the surface as though it were a liquid or stay strong and firm. Regardless of whether or not the surface is solid, her magic allows it to retain its shape and appearance so that it may seem like a solid in appearance despite being transmuted into a liquid form. The platform can be big enough to make a solid diamond-grade formation that covers up to a sixty foot radius (the source being the rune at its epicenter) and if stretched out to its full extent will remain completely stationary. Should the platform be made smaller, however (limited to only measuring a ten foot radius at the most for this second part specifically), the caster may telekinetically control its levitational abilities, allowing her air maneuverability for up to seventy feet above ground, at three times average human speeds. (Caster's personal speed stats do not affect speed stats for levitation.)

<p align="center"><i>Forcient: Transmutation, High Archmage</i></p>
<i>"Forcient is a tree which focuses on the physical constants and laws of the universe, and how one may manipulate these constants and laws to suit their agenda. Forcient is divided into three different branches, each of which controls a small array of forces. Transmutors are a special breed among Forcient mages; rather than control a specific force, these mages wield the power of change. A Transmutor may change the shape, form, and type of matter with their spells. These mages must of course follow the general rule of nature: One cannot make something from nothing, and one may not simply lose matter through a transmutation. High caliber Transmutors may even dissemble matter at a molecular level."</i>
<br><br>
<h1>Paige Spells</h1>
<b>Glass Globe</b><br>
This spell allows the caster to transmute a bit of sand into a baseball sized globe of molten glass just hot enough to melt through tin constructs or nonmagic items (this scales naturally until reaching Iron at Mage rank). While the initial transformation of the sand must be done through physical contact, once the globe is formed it can be telepathically controlled within a five foot radius of the caster. If an extra post is spent charging up energy around the orb, it can travel up to ten feet away from the caster but once it surpasses five feet it can no longer be controlled. Once the globe hits a solid surface it will behave like a liquid and if left on that surface for extended periods of time (say four rotations) it will harden naturally. Cannot reach speeds over 5 MPH.
<br><br>
<b>Window Pane</b><br>
In a similar fashion to the spell known as "Glass Globe," this one allows the caster to transmute sand into a thin pane of molten glass that is only hot enough to melt away magical and nonmagical constructs of tin toughness (naturally scales to iron at Mage). The pane itself can only be five feet tall and two feet wide. So long as initial contact with sand is made by any part of the caster's body, this spell can be formed and can even be moved telepathically around them so long as it remains within a five foot radius. The pane cannot be used like a projectile and when the spell is deactivated it reverts from molten glass back into sand.
<br><br>
<b>Little Pirate</b><br>
In exchange for sand, the caster can form a tin grade blade construct (naturally scales to Iron grade at Mage). This construct takes the shape of a foot-long dagger with harshly curved and serrated edges. In order for the construct to remain intact it must stay within the hands of the caster, should it leave her touch it will revert back into sand once more. Physical contact with sand is required to cast this spell, has to be enough sand to match the size of the blade itself.
<br><br>
<h1>Mage Spells</h1>
<b>Glass Globe (Upgrade)</b><br>
This spell allows the caster to transmute a handful of sand into a basketball sized globe of molten glass just hot enough to melt through iron constructs or nonmagic items (this scales naturally until reaching Cobalt at Expert Mage rank). If used like a projectile the orb can only travel up to fifteen feet away from the caster. Once the globe hits a solid surface it will behave like a liquid and if left on that surface for extended periods of time (say three rotations) it will harden. Cannot reach speeds over 20 MPH. The caster can have a total of three of these orbs active at once.
<br><br>
<b>Window Pane (Upgrade)</b><br>
In a similar fashion to the spell known as "Glass Globe," this one allows the caster to transmute sand into a thin pane of molten glass that is only hot enough to melt away magical and nonmagical constructs of iron toughness (naturally scales to Cobalt at Expert Mage). The pane itself can only be up to seven feet tall and four feet wide. So long as initial contact with sand is made by any part of the caster's body, this spell can be formed and can remain active so long as the caster is within ten feet of the construct. The pane cannot be used like a projectile and when the spell is deactivated it reverts from molten glass back into sand. 
<br><br>
<b>Constructive Change</b><br>
A spell that allows the caster to change the state of matter in typical nonmagic objects and materials so long as they are no higher in toughness or density as lead (scales naturally to Steel at Expert Mage). The objects in question cannot be as big as the caster, or weigh nearly as much, but as long as she touched the base material before it was changed she can expend mana to continuously change it assuming it remains within a ten foot radius of her body. This does not work for biological or sentient material.
<br><br>
<b>Dirty Bomb</b><br>
Pressing her hand against a solid object, the caster can shift certain chemicals inside of it to react with one another, allowing it to explode after a few seconds. The longer she charges this, the bigger the explosion. Explosion radius caps at a radius of twenty feet and cannot destroy objects or constructs greater than Iron toughness.
<br><br>
<b>Noclip</b><br>
The caster can shift most gases underneath her feet into “blocks” of solidified matter for a few seconds each. This matter is strong enough to hold her weight, allowing her to walk on air for a short period of time.

<h1>Expert Mage Spells</h1>
<b>Constructive Change (Upgrade)</b><br>
A spell that allows the caster to change the state of matter in physical and magic-imbued substances and materials (can work on magically affected objects, such as enchanted objects, but does not work specifically on magic. Energy-based substances cannot be affected) so long as they are no higher in toughness or density as steel, and aren't materials from higher ranking spells than the caster (scales naturally to Cobalt at High Mage). The objects in question can only be up to the same size as the caster, and it cannot weigh more than her, but as long as she touched the base material before it was changed she can expend mana to continuously change it assuming it remains within a fifteen foot radius of her body. This does not work for biological or sentient material, and it does not allow her to fluctuate temperatures. For example, if she were to transmute steel into molten liquid steel, her magic would keep the liquid from actually being able to burn and would allow it to remain room temperature.
<br><br>
<b>Glass Globe (Upgrade)</b><br>
This spell allows the caster to transmute physical objects and materials (so long as they are only cobalt in toughness or lower, aren't made from higher ranking spells, and aren't any bigger than the caster in size or weight) into basketball sized globes of molten glass just hot enough to melt through cobalt constructs or nonmagic items (this scales naturally until reaching Titanium at High Mage rank). If used like a projectile the orb can only travel up to twenty feet away from the caster. Once the globe hits a solid surface it will behave like a liquid and if left on that surface for extended periods of time (two rotations) it will harden. Cannot reach speeds over 40 MPH. The caster can have a total of five of these orbs active at once.
<br><br>
<b>Window Pane (Upgrade)</b><br>
This spell allows the caster to transmute physical objects and materials (so long as they are only cobalt in toughness or lower, aren't made from higher ranking spells, and aren't any bigger than the caster in size or weight) into panes of molten glass hot enough to melt through cobalt magic-constructs or nonmagic items (this scales naturally until reaching Titanium at High Mage rank). While these panes cannot be used as projectiles they can remain active within fifteen feet of the caster. When deactivated or "broken" the panes will revert to the base material they were transmuted from. The caster can have a total of two of these panes active at once, and they can only be up to six feet in height and three feet in width at the most. These panes can only defend against solid existing objects and will not be able to deter pure energy substances whatsoever.

<i>"Magic which recreates several forms of magic by imbuing Words of Power with Mana in the form of inscribed runic symbols. A mage of this tree may harness any tree of magic, but only in its lesser forms. A jack of all trades, ace of none tree, runes may be created for singular use (such as powerful explosions or traps), or cast upon an object to provide a spell of multiple uses (although the rune must be re-carved from time to time). Although this tree may start off as inherently weak, it's sheer utility and flexible spell roster make it an excellent choice for a well rounded mage."</i>

<h1>Paige Spells</h1>
<b>Adding Adhesive</b><br>
When applied to a surface and activated, this rune will coat a five foot radius of that surface in a tin-grade adhesive substance for two rotations. When time's up, both the adhesive substance and the rune itself will disappear. (After the rune is set and activated if the caster gets more than twenty feet away from the sigil it will no longer work.)
<br><br>
<b>Hide in Plain Site</b><br>
A rune that, when activated, coats a five foot radius around itself in a thick mist. The magical nature of this mist allows it to scramble sensory spells of equal length or lower. Sensory spells will only be affected within the set radius, if they are from the outside looking in they will remain at their full potential.
<br><br>
<b>Up Button</b><br>
Additional external force is required to truly activate this rune. It is a spell that, if placed on a solid nonmagic surface, can make a five-foot tall column shoot out of said surface at a decent speed (10 MPH). The columns cannot be more than about the size of the average human foot (thickness varies based on the size of the original surface, but cannot be more than a foot thick) and are not lowered until the caster deactivates them or the sigil is destroyed.

<h1>Mage Spells</h1>
<b>Hide in Plain Sight (Upgrade)</b><br>
A rune that, when activated, coats a fifteen foot radius around itself in a thick mist. The magical nature of this mist allows it to scramble sensory spells and abilities of equal length or lower. Sensory spells of equal rank will only be affected within the set radius, if they are from the outside looking in they will remain at their full potential. Lower ranking sensory abilities and spells, however, will be scrambled even if they're from the outside looking in.
<br><br>
<b>Up Button (Upgrade)</b><br>
Additional external force is required to truly activate this rune. It is a spell that, if placed on a solid nonmagic surface, can make a fifteen-foot tall iron grade column shoot out of said surface at a decent speed (20 MPH). The columns cannot be more than about the size of the average human foot (thickness varies based on the size of the original surface, but cannot be more than a foot thick) and are not lowered until the caster deactivates them (continuously drains mana when active) or the sigil is destroyed.
<br><br>
<b>Adding Adhesive (Upgrade)</b><br>
When applied to a surface and activated, this rune will coat a five foot radius of that surface in an iron-grade adhesive substance for two rotations. When time's up, both the adhesive substance and the rune itself will disappear. (After the rune is set and activated if the caster gets more than thirty feet away from the sigil it will no longer work.)
<br><br>
<b>Gentle Pulse</b><br>
When activated, this rune will send out very gentle waves of air in all directions for a twenty foot radius, that aren't any stronger than a gentle breeze. These pulsing currents map out the terrain within that radius and have the potential to feed the caster plenty of information. (For example, the shape of the terrain, if there are any nonmagic traps set.) She can feel anything that physically exists within the radius that the wind touches as long as it's not being hidden by a spell. The rune only remains active for a total of three posts and requires two posts to cool down before she can activate another.
<br><br>
<b>Burst of Speed</b><br>
A permanent rune Claire plans to put on her body that temporarily doubles her reaction time and physical speed. The sigil can only remain active for a total of three rotations before more mana would be required to reactivate it. (Requires a cool down of two posts as well.)
